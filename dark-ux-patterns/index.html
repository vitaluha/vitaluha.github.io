          Hi everyone. Welcome to StirTrek!<br>
          My name is Vitaliy. Today I will be talking about Dark UX Patterns. <br>
          Before I begin, a few words about me: <br>
          I am originally from Ukraine. <br>
          I am a software engineer working for a financial company here in Easton.<br>
          I have a four year old daughter and a 9-day old son. <br>

        <span style="color:yellow;">Dark Patterns</span> are deceptive UX/UI interactions, designed to mislead or trick users to make them do something they don't
        want to do.
        <aside class="notes">
          This term was coined in 2010 after the boom of ecommerce industries on the web.<br>
          In order to generate more sales, get subscriptions, and hit target numbers in transactions, designers and business associates started creating deceiving user interfaces to manipulate users.<br>
          Let's look at a few examples.

          Bait and switch is a pattern is when when a user is looking to take an action that results in a desired outcome, but instead ends up resulting in something completely unforeseen.
        </aside>
        <h3>Bait and Switch</h3>
        <p class="fragment fade-up">Example: Windows 10 Upgrade - even when you close popup - upgrade is started</p>
        <p class="fragment fade-up">
          <img
            width="720"
            src="images/windows.jpg"

      <aside class="notes">
        As you see here, there are multiple action buttons in this popup window. But whether you click 'Upgrade Now', 'OK', or 'Close' icon - Windows upgrade would automatically start.

        <aside class="notes">
          This pattern is adopted so that ads are disguised in the page, as if they were a part of the regular content or navigation. <br>
           That is supposed to make users click them more often
        </aside>
        <h3>Disguised Ads</h3>
        <p class="fragment fade-up">Example: Yelp Ad looks like a search result</p>
        <p class="fragment fade-up">
          <img
            width="640"
            src="images/yelp.png"
            alt=""
          >
        </p>
      </section>
      <section
        data-transition="fade"
        data-transition-speed="fast"
        data-background="images/yelp - highlight.png"
      >
      <aside class="notes">
        Even though the first search result clearly says it's an ad (in yellow), it is disguised to look like a real search result sorted by number of positive reviews.<br> The ad looks almost identical to the search result, with picture on the left, phone number on the right and description on the bottom. <br>
        Yelp constantly changes its user interface and it might look a little different now.

          Found on a large number of subscription based websites that give out free trials.<br>
          Forced Continuity is a dark pattern in which the user signs up for a free trial but has to enter their credit card details. When the trial ends, they start getting charged. <br>
          There's no opportunity to opt out, no reminder, and no easy way to cancel the automatic charging of their credit card
        </aside>
        <h3>Forced Continuity </h3>
        <p class="fragment fade-up">Example: Hello Fresh, Blue Apron</p>
        <p class="fragment fade-up">
          <img
            width="640"

        <h3>Friend Spam </h3>
          <aside class="notes">
            This kind of Dark Pattern occurs when the product asks for the user's email or social media permissions under the pretense it will be used for a desirable outcome e.g. finding friends, but then spams all their contacts in a message that claims to be from them.
          </aside>
          <p class="fragment fade-up">Example: LinkedIn</p>
          <img

            When search results are displayed, it prominently features the daily rate for each accommodation.
            But the daily rate excludes additional amounts, including cleaning fees and Airbnb's service fee. <br>While the company does display a total price when a user selects dates for their stay, they have to click to see a breakdown of the additional fees charged.<br>
            What's more, when a customer filters by price, Airbnb does not factor in additional fees. For
            instance, if a user specifies that she wants to spend up to $25 per night for a two-night stay, Airbnb's search results can contain listings for which the total price exceeds $50 as a result of additional fees.

            Recently, Airbnb addressed the issue by rolling out a “display total price” button. When you toggle it, all prices listed
            across the app—whether in cost-filtered search results, on maps, or on one-off property pages—are calculated to include
            fees (but exclude taxes).<br>
            Total price will include all fees before taxes and be shown in search results, as well as on the map, filter, and
            listing page. Before confirming their booking, guests can still view a full price breakdown that shows Airbnb's service
            fee, discounts, and taxes.

          The design makes it very easy for the user to get into a certain situation, but then makes it hard for them to get out of. <br>

          Citibank committed one of the "biggest blunders in banking history" when it accidentally wired $900 million in
          payments last year to Revlon's lenders, when it only intended to send $7.8 million.

          While some good samaritan lenders returned the extra payments, others did not, leaving a $500 million deficit
          in the balance.

          What's more, a judge this month ruled that Citibank isn't entitled to that $500 million, so what was a user
          error is now a complete company loss.

          Ars Technica summed up how the mistake occurred in the first place: "Kludgey software and a poorly designed
          user interface contributed to the massive screwup."

            It features a 32 year old who started trading and lost a lot of money.
            He says that he was charmed by Robinhood's one-click trading, easy access to complex investment products, and features like confetti and emoji-filled phone notifications that made it feel like a game.<br>
            After funding his account with $15,000 in credit card advances, he began spending more time on the app.<br>
            He took out home equity loans ($60K+) so he could buy and sell more speculative stocks and options.
            His account value reached one million dollars and very quickly went down.

            Here is a sad story about Alex Kearns, a 20 year old  student at the University of Nebraska, who took up stock investing during the pandemic, signing up for Robinhood.  <br>
            As the Covid-19 stock market swung wildly, Kearns had begun experimenting, trading options (which are very risky for uneducated customers). His final note, filled with anger toward Robinhood, says that he had “no clue” what he was doing.

            Here is  screenshot from Kearns' mobile phone reveals that while his account had a negative $730,165 cash balance displayed in
            red, it may not have represented uncollateralized indebtedness at all, but rather his temporary balance until the stocks
            underlying his assigned options actually settled into his account.<br>
            Alex did not understand this from app's user interface. He may not have realized that his negative cash balance displaying on his Robinhood home screen was only temporary
            and would be corrected once the underlying stock was credited to his account.

              According to a PwC study, a majority of customers said that the customer experience was one of the most important factors in

                It can be tempting to turn to dark patterns in an attempt to increase user engagement, subscriptions, and purchases. <br>
                But incorporating these manipulative techniques will ultimately erode customer trust and may cause your users to leave. <br>
                Providing customers with an experience that keeps their best interest in mind is the smart way to protect your
                business in the long run.
