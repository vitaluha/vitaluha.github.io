### Grey patterns

1. A gray pattern (defined in my own words) is when a design can create a good, helpful experience for one user, while simultaneously manipulating another user to take action against his/her own will. The balance between helpfulness and harmfulness is blurry as hell here. Adding to that, many designers are not aware of their contribution to the gray pattern, and many users have no idea that they are partaking in it either.

Think about “recommended for you” sections on the bottom of an article for example. This type of design can be helpful for users but it can also make them stay longer on the site than they intended to. Some users might see this design as dark, but those who find these sections helpful, might see it as light.
